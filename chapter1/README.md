## A module to implement the stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm (using backpropagation) for a feedforward neural network.

Those codes were written by [Michael Nielson](http://michaelnielsen.org/) and presented in his [free online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). The original ones be found in the [repository "neural-networks-and-deep-learning" from his Github page](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).

Since I am reeding Nielson's online free book, I copied his code here just for pedagogical reasons, adding some comments by my own.

The codes in this repository are prepared for Python 3 compatibility with the help of the [updated scrips by Michal Daniel Dobrzanski](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35).
